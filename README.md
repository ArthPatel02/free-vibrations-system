### üìå Repository Description:
- This repository contains the analytical derivation and MATLAB implementation of free vibration responses for a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system under different damping conditions.
The system considered has:
  - Mass (m): 10 kg
  - Stiffness (k): 1000 N/m
  - Initial Displacement (u‚ÇÄ): 0.1 m
  - Initial Velocity (v‚ÇÄ): 10 m/s
  
### üîπ Key Features:
Analytical solutions for:
  1. Undamped Vibration
  2. Underdamped Vibration (c < c‚Çê)
  3. Critically damped Vibration (c = c‚Çê)
  4. Overdamped Vibration (c > c‚Çê)
   
### üîß Tools Used:
- MATLAB for simulation and plotting.
- Structural Dynamics theory for analytical derivations.

### üìä Output
- Time-displacement response plots for each damping case.
- Combined comparison of undamped, underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped systems.

     ```
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub, click "Compare & pull request," and submit your PR.

## Basic GitHub Commands üñ•Ô∏è
  - `git add <filename> / git add *` : Add one or more files to staging (index)
- `git commit -m "Commit message"` : Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository)
- `git push origin main` : Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository
- `git status` : List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit
- `git push origin <branchname>` : Push the branch to your remote repository, so others can use it
- `git pull` : Fetch and merge changes on the remote server to your working directory
